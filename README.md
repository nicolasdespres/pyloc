# Welcome to pyloc

_pyloc_ prints the location of the definition of any python object in
your file-system.

# Introduction

_pyloc_ is very similar to what `python3 -m inspect -d <object>`
offers. However, it is only focused to retrieve the file name (and
eventually the line number) defining a given Python object. The object
can be a package, module, class, method or function. _pyloc_ outputs
is formatted so that it can easily be passed to `emacsclient` or `vi`.

# Examples

You can see the location of `Popen.wait` method in the sub-process package.

```sh
$ python -m pyloc -f human subprocess:Popen.wait
Filename: /Users/polrop/.pyenv/versions/2.7.9/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py
Line: 1379

$ python -m pyloc -f human email.utils:formataddr
Filename: /Users/polrop/.pyenv/versions/2.7.9/lib/python2.7/email/utils.py
Line: 85
```

(Output may be different on your system since you have different
installation path and version)

Note that the object naming syntax is as follow: `module[:qualname]`

To open it in Emacs you can do:

```sh
emacsclient `python -m pyloc -f emacs subprocess:Popen.wait`
```

or in vim:

```sh
vim `python -m pyloc -f vi subprocess:Popen.wait`
```

If you are lazy typing `-f <format>` all the time and you often use
the same format, you can set the default output format this way (you
can add this line in your `.zshenv` or `.bashrc`):

```
export PYLOC_DEFAULT_FORMAT=emacs
```

_pyloc_ will always locate object based on the `python` interpreter
your are using:

```sh
# Python 3
$ python3 -m pyloc subprocess:Popen.wait
Filename: /Users/polrop/.pyenv/versions/3.4.3/lib/python3.4/subprocess.py
Line: 1526
# Local system python2
$ /usr/local/bin/python -m pyloc -f human email.utils:formataddr
Filename: /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/email/utils.py
Line: 85
# System python2
$ /usr/bin/python -m pyloc -f human email.utils:formataddr
Filename: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/email/utils.py
Line: 85
```

# Known bugs

_pyloc_ does not a fully compliant python parser to locate the class
definition line number. So you may experienced problem like with:

```sh
python -m pyloc -f human subprocess:Popen
```
